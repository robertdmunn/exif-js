#Exif.js

A JavaScript library for reading EXIF meta data from JPEG image files.

Dependencies

NodeJS
npm
bower

If you plan on developing exif.js, you can clone the repo or download the zip from the links at right. Once the project is on your machine go to a command prompt in the project root and type:

npm update
grunt

That will load the dependencies and make an initial build of the source.

You can also type:

grunt watch

which will leave the command running. What that does is monitor the source files for changes and run a new build when the source changes.
